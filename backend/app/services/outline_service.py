                    Create a logical outline with main ideas and subtopics that would work well for the given paper.
                    
                    Structure the outline following academic conventions:
                    - Begin with an introduction section that presents a compelling thesis statement
                    - Include body sections with clear main ideas that support the thesis
                    - End with a conclusion section that synthesizes the arguments
                    
                    For each main idea, write a complete sentence that begins with an instruction like "Discuss..." or "Analyze..." or "Examine..." that clearly explains what should be covered in this major section.
                    
                    For each subtopic, write a complete 1-2 sentence instruction that:
                    - Begins with a directive verb (e.g., "Explore...", "Investigate...", "Compare...", "Evaluate...")
                    - Provides specific guidance on what to write about in that subsection
                    - Suggests particular examples, data points, or arguments to include
                    - Connects to the overall thesis where appropriate
                    
                    Write as if you are providing instructions to a college student who will be writing this paper.
                    Your outline should demonstrate depth of thought and sophisticated understanding of the subject matter."""},
